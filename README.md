# Programming for Data Science with Python
## Overview
This Nanodegree is provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104) and sponsored by [Misk Foundation](https://hub.misk.org.sa/ar/programs/categories/root/skills/).

Learn the programming fundamentals required for a career in data science. By the end of the program, you will be able to use Python, SQL, Command Line, and Git.

## Program Courses
### Introduction to SQL
Learn SQL fundamentals such as JOINs, Aggregations, and Subqueries. Learn how to use SQL to answer complex business problems.
* [**Project1: Investigate a Relational Database**](https://github.com/TMQ5/Programming-for-Data-Science-with-Python/tree/main/Investigate%20a%20Relational%20Database%20Project)
In this project, you’ll work with a relational database while working with PostgreSQL. You’ll complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question, running appropriate SQL queries to answer your questions, and finishing by sharing your findings.


### Introduction to Python Programming
Learn Python programming fundamentals such as data structures, variables, loops, and functions. Learn to work with data using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
* [**Project2: Explore US Bikeshare Data**](https://github.com/TMQ5/Programming-for-Data-Science-with-Python/tree/main/Explore%20US%20Bikeshare%20Data%20Project)
You will use Python to answer analytical questions about bikeshare trip data collected from three US cities. You will write code to collect the data, compute descriptive statistics, and create an interactive experience in the terminal that presents the answers to your questions.


### Introduction to Version Control
Learn how to use version control and share your work with other people in the data science industry.
* [**Post your Work on GitHub**](https://github.com/TMQ5/Programming-for-Data-Science-with-Python/tree/main/Post%20your%20Work%20on%20GitHub)
In this project, you will learn important tools that all programmers use. First, you’ll get an introduction to working in the terminal. Next, you’ll learn to use git and Github to manage versions of a program and collaborate with others on programming projects. You will post two different versions of a Jupyter Notebook capturing your learnings from the course, and add commits to your project Git repository.
