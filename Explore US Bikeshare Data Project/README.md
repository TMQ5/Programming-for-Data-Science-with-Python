# Explore US Bikeshare Data
## Project Description
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to [bike share systems](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/March/5aab379c_bikeshare-2/bikeshare-2.zip) for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Statistics Computed
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

#### 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day
#### 2 Popular stations and trip

most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
#### 3 Trip duration

total travel time
average travel time
#### 4 User info

counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
