## Project Description
In this project, you will query the [Sakila DVD Rental](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/) database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, you will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.

## Project Submissions
### Presentations
You are now on the portion of the project you will need to submit to a reviewer. To pass this project follow the instructions below to create a presentation. You will submit a zip file with two items:

* Slide Deck (4 slides)
* Text File with SQL queries

Your presentation should include:

* Four slides
* One question on each slide
* One visualization (graph / chart / table) per slide
* A 1-2 sentence answer to the question, based on the data and visualization, on each slide
* Indicate which code in the attached text file was used to create the visualization OR add the query used to generate the visualization.

You may use any slideshow application you like, such as Google Slides, Powerpoint, or Keynote.
In order to review your presentation, you will need to save your slides as a PDF.

### Queries
Please create a text file, using an application such as Notepad, Notepad++, or any other text editor - at Udacity we are fond of Atom. This file should include each of the queries you used to create your visualizations.

An important aspect of writing SQL queries is following a recommended format. This will improve readability and troubleshooting when you encounter an exception or error. Such highly recommended SQL guides are the following:
* [SQL Style Guide](https://www.sqlstyle.guide)

### Visualizations
We suggest you use a spreadsheet application, such as Excel or Google Sheets to create your visualizations. However, you’re welcome to use whatever tool you’d like.
You should have four slides that are similar to the Submission Slide Example below. Remember:

* The questions you ask are up to you.
* All four of your final submitted queries should contain a JOIN and AGGREGATION.
* At least two of your final submitted queries should contain either a subquery OR a CTE.
* At least one of your final submitted queries should contain a Window Function.
* At least one column generated by the Window Function should be included in one of your final visualization.
